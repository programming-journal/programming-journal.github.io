*The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming* is sponsored by AOSA, a non-profit association whose purpose is the support of science and research, and in particular to facilitate the dissemination of scientific results pertaining to advances in programming. The publication of the journal is one of its primary activities, the other one being the organization of an annual conference. The association was founded in 2001, and its directors are: Robert HIrschfeld (president), Theo D'Hondt (vice president), and Mario Sudholt (treasurer). 

AOSA is a tax-exempt organization. The journal's editors, executive board, editorial board, and staff all serve on an unpaid volunteer basis, and their work is made possible by the research institutions and universities who support them.

The association welcomes charitable donations, including individual and corporate gifts of money, equipment and personnel to help support the operation of the journal. Individuals and organizations wishing to make donations to support the journal should contact the treasurer.
