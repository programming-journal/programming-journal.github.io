*The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming*  was created with the goal of placing the wonderful art of programming in the map of scholarly works. Many academic journals and conferences exist that publish research related to programming, starting with programming languages, software engineering, and expanding to the whole Computer Science field. Yet, many of us feel that, as the field of Computer Science expanded, programming, in itself, has been neglected to a secondary role not worthy of scholarly attention. That is a serious gap, as much of the progress in Computer Science lies on the basis of computer programs, the people who write them, and the concepts and tools available to them to express computational tasks.

The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming aims at closing this gap by focusing primarily on programming: the art itself (programming styles, pearls, models, languages), the emerging science of understanding what works and what doesn't work in general and in specific contexts, as well as more established engineering and mathematical perspectives.

Here are some of the highlights of this new journal:

* Diamond open access, free-of-charge to authors. The articles are accessible to everyone, forever, and the authors don't need to pay any fee. We are able to do this, because everyone involved in the operation of this journal does it on a voluntary, unpaid basis, and also because the journal's owner, the non-profit AOSA, is able to cover the remaining operating costs.
* All articles are published under a Creative Commons license.
* The journal is an overlay on arXiv, meaning that we upload all articles to arXiv as a long-term storage system. Additionally, we also store the papers on servers at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium, at the University of California, Irvine, USA, and the Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam, Germany.
* Papers can be submitted at any time, but submissions are batched and processed in cycles with strict deadlines for reviewers, authors, and editors. We start with three cycles per year, but may consider increasing it in the future.
* Speed: four months between the the start of the reviewing cycles and publication.
* Strong social media presence, and association with the [‹Programming› conference][programming] for broad dissemination of the papers.
